# Course Project

This repository contains practice exercises for the _Web Application Development_ at WWU.
It has been adapted from _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

# Project Description

This is a project created by Matthew DeChance, Garrett Moody, Grace Morales, Theo Moen, and Will Hensel 
for CPTR220 at Walla Walla University. 

The project will be creating a virtual game shelf to
catalog a person's board game colection. The user will be able to add, organize, and rate each game they own. This app will also
allow users to save their progress in the longer games. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. 

# How to Use App

The App contains several pages as follows:
- A Home page
- An About page
- A Catalog page
- A Saved Games page

The Home pages shares a basic overview of the app and what it contains. 
The About page contains more in-depth descriptions of what the app can do and how to do them. 
The Catalog page allows a user to search for various games, save games to a list, and rate those games. 
The Saved Games page allows a user to upload and save a picture of the progress of a game they may be in the middle of that they cannot finish.
